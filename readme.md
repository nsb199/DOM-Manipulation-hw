DOM Manipulation Showcase

Welcome to the DOM Manipulation Showcase! This project demonstrates how to change the style of an HTML element using JavaScript. 

The live version of this project can be viewed [here](https://nsb199.github.io/DOM-Manipulation-hw/).

## Project Overview

In this project, we use JavaScript's `getElementById` method to fetch a specific `div` element from the HTML document and then dynamically change its background color, text color, margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, and width. This showcases the power and flexibility of JavaScript for modifying the appearance of elements on a webpage.

## How to Use

Simply open the hosted version of the project to see the changes applied to the `div` element in real-time. Feel free to explore the code to see how each style property is manipulated using JavaScript.
